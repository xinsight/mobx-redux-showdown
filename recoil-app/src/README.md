Was excited to try recoil, but it seems that to require that the data "model" be part of a react component.

There is an approach to use a "dispatcher" - but it still seems a bit awkward to use. https://github.com/GeoffCox/recoil-examples/tree/master/dispatcher-tutorial

The main issue seems to be the lack of clear split between view and models. (Models ideally would be pure JS, and have no knowledge of the view layer.)

Abandoning this for now.
